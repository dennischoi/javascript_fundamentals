// Exercises: Arrays

// EXERCISE: Your top choices

// Create an array to hold your top choices (colors, presidents, whatever).
// For each choice, log to the screen a string like: "My #1 choice is blue."
// Bonus: Change it to log "My 1st choice, "My 2nd choice", "My 3rd choice", picking the right suffix for the number based on what it is.


var veggies = ['Carrot', 'Cucumber', 'Tomato', 'Zucchini']
console.log('My #1 Veggie is ' + veggies[0] + '.')
My #1 Veggie is Carrot.
console.log('My #1 Veggie is ' + veggies[1] + '.')
My #1 Veggie is Cucumber.
console.log('My #1 Veggie is ' + veggies[2] + '.')
My #1 Veggie is Tomato.
console.log('My #1 Veggie is ' + veggies[3] + '.')
My #1 Veggie is Zucchini.



Bonus:
console.log('My #1 Veggie is ' + veggies[0] + ', My 2nd choice is ' + veggies[1] + ', 3rd is ' + veggies[2] + ', Last but not least... ' + veggies[3] + '.')
  ==> My #1 Veggie is Carrot, My 2nd choice is Cucumber, 3rd is Tomato, Last but not least... Zucchini.
